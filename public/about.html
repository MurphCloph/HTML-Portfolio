<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Murphy Clophus III is a up and coming full stack developer from Houston, Texas. It has been
  a long tome coming for Murphy. He has tried to do this time and time again, but time just
  wasnt on his side. But recently, he has come to realize that time will never be just right 
  for him to have the time to do this without any other distractions. He has to make the time
  to get this done. He has always wanted to be a full stack developer and nothing is going to 
  stop him now.
</p>

<p>While Murphy is taking this course to become a full stack developer, he is also taking
  a course to get his PMP certification. He didnt think that he would be a good project 
  manager. He has tried to do it before, but he ended up falling flat on his face and lost
  a job that he had been on for 8 years. But, the job that he is on now, I know that he will
  excel with having a PMP certification, and that will add more value to him in the job market.
</p>

<p>So with getting a PMP certification and being a full stack developer, Murphy will be able
  to choose the career that he wants and have experience to do all that he wants. It is looking
  bright for one Murphy Clophus III.

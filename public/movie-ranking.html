<h1>The Best Movies According to Murphy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 monies of all-time!!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie. I can sit and watch this movie everyday.
 The reason why I like this movie so much is that it has many different 
 elements to it and it ends on a pleasant note about friends.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence make the perfect team in this movie. 
Although they had their falling out, in the end they got out of jail 
the same way that they went into jail, together.</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Forrest Gump gives everyone hope. Although Forrest wasnt the sharpest knife
 in the drawer, he made his life worth while. Everyone have gone
through that once in their life, and that is what makes the
 movie memorable.</p>
